# Video Concatenation Function Improvements

## Summary

Based on user feedback, the following improvements have been implemented for the video concatenation functionality:

## Changes Made

### 1. **Simplified Service with Always-On Autocomplete**
- The `AskQuestionService.select()` method now always uses autocomplete
- Removed the separate `autocomplete()` method to keep the API clean
- Eliminated the option parameter since autocomplete is now the standard behavior
- This provides a consistent user experience across all selection prompts

### 2. **Enhanced Video Selection with Autocomplete**
- The `multiSelectVideosFromQueue()` function uses the improved select method (which uses autocomplete)
- Users can now type to search through available videos, making selection much faster
- Particularly useful when there are many completed videos to choose from

### 3. **Improved Video Ordering**
- Videos are now sorted by creation date (most recent first)
- Uses the `createdAt` timestamp to determine recency
- Most recently created videos appear at the top of the list for easier access

### 4. **Better Command Positioning**
- The "End - Finish selecting videos" option is now positioned at the very top of the choices list
- This makes it immediately accessible without scrolling through all videos
- Provides a clear and quick way to finish the selection process

### 5. **Enhanced Display Information**
- Video titles now show both date and time (e.g., "Video Name (12/25/2024 2:30 PM)")
- More precise timestamps help users identify the exact video they want
- Better differentiation between videos created on the same day

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `packages/ffmpeg/src/services.ts` - Enhanced AskQuestionService with autocomplete support
- `packages/ffmpeg/src/workflows.ts` - Updated multiSelectVideosFromQueue function

### New API Methods
```typescript
// Simplified select method that always uses autocomplete
select: <T>(
  question: string,
  choices: Array<{ title: string; value: T }>
): Effect.Effect<T>
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Faster Navigation**: Autocomplete allows quick filtering of videos by typing
2. **Better Organization**: Most recent videos at the top, "End" command immediately accessible
3. **Clearer Information**: Enhanced timestamps for better video identification
4. **Consistent UX**: Autocomplete is now always enabled for all selection prompts

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Reduced time to find and select specific videos
- **Usability**: More intuitive interface following common CLI patterns
- **Scalability**: Better performance with large numbers of completed videos
- **Consistency**: Simplified API with autocomplete always enabled
- **Simplicity**: Single selection method reduces complexity and improves maintainability
