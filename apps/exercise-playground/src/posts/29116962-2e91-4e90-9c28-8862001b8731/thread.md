Turns out I was totally off-base with a post I made last week.

You'll never need to write a `.js` import again, thanks to this new flag in TS 5.7.

The TS team changed their mind. This is massive.

ðŸ§µ

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
// WHY DO I NEED TO USE A .JS EXTENSION HERE? GRAH

import ts from "./my-file.js";
```

This is the flag you'll need to add to your `tsconfig.json`.

This rewrites relative `.ts` extensions to `.js` extensions when you use `tsc` to bundle your code. You'll also need `allowImportingTsExtensions`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // New flag!
    "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true,
    // Also needed:
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true
  }
}
```

You might ask, why didn't it always work this way?

Well, TS was adamant about not changing runtime behaviour. Changing a `.ts` import to a `.js` import is a runtime change. TS prefers to think of itself these days as just "JavaScript with types".

So, I'm kind of shocked that they changed their mind.

Personally, I've been pretty happy with these `.js` extensions. I compile my code with `tsc` and run it with Node.

I like knowing that the file path I'm seeing is the file path that Node is using.

BUT, this is extremely confusing for beginners.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
// Beginners, prepare to get confused.

import ts from "./my-ts-file.js";
```

So, here's a big list of all the transformations that will be targeted with this flag:

If it's got an extension, it'll be transformed (YES). But if it targets a .d.ts file, or it's a non-relative import, it won't be transformed (NO).

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import ts from "./a.ts"; // YES
import tsx from "./b.tsx"; // YES
import mts from "./c.mts"; // YES
import mtsx from "./d.mtsx"; // YES
import cts from "./e.cts"; // YES
import ctsx from "./f.ctsx"; // YES

await import("./a.ts"); // YES
require("./a.ts"); // YES

import a from "./a"; // NO, no extension
import b from "./b.d.ts"; // NO, targets .d.ts file
import c from "~/c.ts"; // NO, non-relative import
```

Here's the PR where it landed.

What do you think? Excited about this flag?

I'm pretty sure this will end up in my recommended TSConfig Cheat Sheet for when you're transpiling with tsc.

Hard to see this as anything other than a massive improvement.
