I've changed my mind on .d.ts files.

If you're writing application code, you should NEVER use them.

Let me explain ðŸ§µ

Declaration files are files that only contain types.

They've got two purposes - providing types for JavaScript files, and augmenting types in the global scope.

Here's the section on them in my book:

---

You'll see them a lot in your node_modules folder. Every package comes with a lot of .d.ts files to provide types for the JavaScript files they ship.

Since you don't control these types, you shouldn't receive type errors from them - so there's a setting in your tsconfig.json to disable them.

It's called `skipLibCheck`, and I recommend it for all TS projects.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

---

However, this has an unfortunate downside. It also means that `.d.ts` files you write yourself will never show TypeScript errors.

For instance, you can't add implementations to functions in `.d.ts` files:

```ts twoslash
// @filename: my-file.d.ts
// @skipLibCheck: false
// @errors: 1183

// ---cut---
// my-file.d.ts
export function myFunc() {
  return "hello";
}
```

---

But with `skipLibCheck` set to `true`, it appears like you can:

```ts twoslash
// No error!
export function myFunc() {
  return "hello";
}
```

---

You might be asking - what can `.d.ts` files do that `.ts` files can't?

Well, not much. You can emulate the behavior of a global `.d.ts` file with `declare global` in a `.ts` file:

```ts twoslash
// my-file.ts
declare global {
  // Id is now available globally!
  type Id = string | number;
}

export {};
```

---

As a side note, `export {}` is important sometimes, depending on whether your tsconfig treats the file as a module or a script.

There's a bit of the book for that:

https://www.totaltypescript.com/books/total-typescript-essentials/modules-scripts-and-declaration-files#understanding-modules-and-scripts

---

`declare global` lets you do everything you'd need to do in a `.d.ts` file, but with type checking enabled.

It has the same limitations, too - no implementations allowed:

```ts twoslash
// @filename: my-file.ts
// @errors: 1183
// ---cut---
declare global {
  function myFunc() {
    return "hello";
  }
}
```

---

The only thing I've found that `declare global` can't do is totally override the types of another module.

But this is so rarely needed that it almost doesn't count towards this argument.

https://www.totaltypescript.com/books/total-typescript-essentials/modules-scripts-and-declaration-files#module-augmentation-vs-module-overriding

---

So, since:

- `skipLibCheck` MUST always be set to `true`, meaning `.d.ts` files are never type-checked.
- `declare global` can do 99% of what `.d.ts` files can (and the last 1% is rarely needed)

I've started to recommend never using `.d.ts` files in application code.
