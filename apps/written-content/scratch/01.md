JSDoc is a syntax for adding documentation to the types and functions in your code. It allows VS Code to show additional information in the popup that shows when hovering.

This is extremely useful when working with a team

Here's an example of how a `logValues` function could be documented:

````ts
/**
 * Logs the values of an object to the console.
 *
 * @param obj - The object to log.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * logValues({ a: 1, b: 2 });
 * // Output:
 * // a: 1
 * // b: 2
 * ```
 */
const logValues = (obj: any) => {
  for (const key in obj) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${obj[key]}`);
  }
};
````

The `@param` tag is used to describe the parameters of the function. The `@example` tag is used to provide an example of how the function can be used.

There are many, many more tags available for use in JSDoc comments. You can find a full list of them in the [JSDoc documentation](https://jsdoc.app/).

Adding JSDoc comments is a useful way to communicate the purpose and usage of your code, whether you're working on a library, a team, or your own personal projects.
