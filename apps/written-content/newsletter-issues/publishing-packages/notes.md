## Useful Libraries

- ðŸ¦‹ **[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)** is a must-have. It automates changelogs and releases. It comes in several parts:

  - A [**CLI**](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md) for adding changesets, little `.md` files which indicate what changed in a package, and whether it was a patch, minor, or major change.
  - A [**GitHub Bot**](https://github.com/changesets/bot) for reminding folks to add changesets to their PR's.
  - A [**GitHub Action**](https://github.com/changesets/action) that lets you publish to `npm` by merging a PR.
  - Works great in a monorepo, or for single packages.
  - Read the [intro](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md) to get started.

- **[`tsup`](https://github.com/egoist/tsup)** can build your code for you. It can dual publish `esm` and `cjs`. It uses `esbuild` under the hood, so it's fast. An alternative is [**`tshy`**](https://github.com/isaacs/tshy), which uses `tsc` under the hood.

- **[`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it)**
