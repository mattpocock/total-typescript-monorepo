## Using video

Extremely high CTR: 10.1%.

### Topic

New runtime feature - seems to be extremely popular and cross over to JS (and even other languages).

### Title

`var, const, let... now 'using'?`

Compares to previous knowledge - adds a new item to an existing category.
Wraps to one line. Concise.

### Thumbnail

`using db`

- New JavaScript keyword!

Shows the syntax on the video. Syntax example is short enough to see on a small screen.

Red arrow pointing at the thing that's new. Curiosity is peaked.

### Video

Length is 4:26. Short enough for a pop song.
