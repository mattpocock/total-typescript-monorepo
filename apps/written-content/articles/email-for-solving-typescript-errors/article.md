Subject: The most frustrating thing about TypeScript...

Hey <name>,

The most frustrating thing about TypeScript - by far - is the way it tells you when something's wrong.

"Types of property are incompatible."

"Conversion of type X may be a mistake."

"Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable."

It can feel like reading a legal document in a foreign language.

So, I thought I'd ship something to help.

This week, we've shipped a new tutorial - [Solving TypeScript Errors](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/solving-typescript-errors). It goes through 10 of the most common errors you'll see, and how to solve them.

The number of exercises across our [free tutorials](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials) now stands a 59. FIFTY-NINE. That's basically a whole paid module in itself.

So if you haven't yet, dive in. Nothing like getting a win under your belt at the start of a new year.

And that reminds me. Happy new year! Whatever your plans, I hope they go smoothly and don't all involve TypeScript.

Matt
