# TypeScript 5.0 Beta is out!

What's up wizards!

TypeScript 5.0 beta is out, [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0-beta/) and all. It's a big release that adds some exciting new features and syntaxes to try.

It brings support for [ECMAScript decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators), a syntax for wrapping class methods with functions to compose functionality.

For fans of generics, const annotations give you a very nice syntax for inferring literals inside generic functions.
