TypeScript 5.3 dropped last week.

And one of its most important changes wasn't even mentioned in the release notes.

ðŸ§µ

```ts twoslash
// This would error in 5.2, but is allowed in 5.3!
const array = ["a", "b", "c"] as const satisfies string[];

const returnWhatIPassIn = <const T extends any[]>(t: T) => {
  return t;
};

// result is any[] in TS 5.2, but ['a', 'b', 'c'] in 5.3
const result = returnWhatIPassIn(["a", "b", "c"]);
```

Working with readonly arrays in TS is occasionally a bit of a pain.

Let's say you want to declare an array of routes as const.

This lets you reuse the paths declared there for a type.

```ts twoslash
declare const Home: any;
declare const About: any;

// ---cut---

const arrayOfRoutes = [
  { path: "/home", component: Home },
  { path: "/about", component: About },
] as const;

type Route = (typeof arrayOfRoutes)[number]["path"];
//    ^?
```

---

But what if you want to make sure that the `arrayOfRoutes` conforms to a certain type?

For that, you can use satisfies.

But in TypeScript 5.2, this would error!

But... Why?

```ts twoslash
import React from "react";
declare const Home: any;
declare const About: any;

// ---cut---

const arrayOfRoutes = [
  { path: "/home", component: Home },
  { path: "/about", component: About },
] as const satisfies {
  path: string;
  component: React.FC;
}[];
// Type is 'readonly' and cannot be
// assigned to a mutable type
```

---

Well, it's because `arrayOfRoutes` is readonly, and you can't satisfiy a mutable array with a readonly one.

So, the fix was to make the type we were satisfying a `readonly` array:

```ts twoslash
import React from "react";
declare const Home: any;
declare const About: any;

// ---cut---

const arrayOfRoutes = [
  { path: "/home", component: Home },
  { path: "/about", component: About },
] as const satisfies readonly {
  path: string;
  component: React.FC;
}[];

// No more error!
```

---

The same was true when using const type parameters, but even more pernicious.

In this position, 'const' infers the thing passed in to 'T' as if it were 'as const'.

But if you try to constrain it with an array, it doesn't work!

```ts twoslash
const returnWhatIPassIn = <const T extends any[]>(t: T) => {
  return t;
};

// result is any[] in TS 5.2!
const result = returnWhatIPassIn(["a", "b", "c"]);
```

---

Before TS 5.3, the fix was to add readonly to the type parameter:

```ts twoslash
const returnWhatIPassIn = <const T extends readonly any[]>(
  t: T
) => {
  return t;
};

// result is ['a', 'b', 'c']!
const result = returnWhatIPassIn(["a", "b", "c"]);
```

---

But since 5.3, TypeScript has relaxed the rules around readonly arrays.

In these two situations, TypeScript now acts more helpfully:

```ts twoslash
// This would error in 5.2, but is allowed in 5.3!
const array = ["a", "b", "c"] as const satisfies string[];
//    ^?

const returnWhatIPassIn = <const T extends any[]>(t: T) => {
  return t;
};

// result is any[] in TS 5.2, but ['a', 'b', 'c'] in 5.3
const result = returnWhatIPassIn(["a", "b", "c"]);
//    ^?
```

---

Note that there is a small difference! If you were to specify `readonly string[]` instead of `string[]`, you would get a readonly array back.

So you still need to specify readonly if you want a readonly array back.

```ts twoslash
// This would error in 5.2, but is allowed in 5.3!
const array = [
  //  ^?
  "a",
  "b",
  "c",
] as const satisfies readonly string[];

const returnWhatIPassIn = <const T extends readonly any[]>(
  t: T
) => {
  return t;
};

// result is any[] in TS 5.2, but ['a', 'b', 'c'] in 5.3
const result = returnWhatIPassIn(["a", "b", "c"]);
//    ^?
```

---

But this is a massive improvement, making both const type parameters and satisfies much easier to work with.

TypeScript - you gotta shout about these things! I'll be updating my course, Total TypeScript, with this new behaviour very soon.
