# Alongside Flag Improvements Implementation

## Summary

Successfully improved the `--alongside` flag to package the article, transcript, and code file together in a single meta folder instead of just saving the article alongside the video.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Article Generation Core (`packages/ffmpeg/src/article-from-transcript.ts`)

**Before**: Article was saved directly alongside the video with the video's name
**After**: Creates a `{VIDEO_NAME}_meta` folder containing:
- Article (`{VIDEO_NAME}.md`)
- Transcript (copied from original location)
- Code file (if provided, using original filename)

**Key Changes**:
- Added `transcriptPath` and `codePath` parameters to `generateArticleCore`
- Modified `alongside-video` storage mode to create meta folder structure
- Added filesystem operations: `makeDirectory`, `copyFile`, and conditional code file writing
- Video remains in original location (not moved to meta folder)

### 2. Updated Queue Generation (`packages/ffmpeg/src/queue-article-generation.ts`)

**Enhanced Features**:
- Pass transcript path and code path to article generation
- Updated console logging to reflect meta folder creation
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing queue processing

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage (`packages/ffmpeg/src/queue-article-generation.test.ts`)

**New Test Cases**:
1. **Meta folder with all files**: Tests creation of `{VIDEO_NAME}_meta` folder with article, transcript, and code
2. **Meta folder without code**: Tests that no code file is added when not provided
3. **Shorts directory support**: Tests meta folder creation in shorts directory when `dryRun: false`

**Test Assertions**:
- ✅ Meta folder created with correct name format: `{VIDEO_NAME}_meta`
- ✅ Article written to meta folder with proper content
- ✅ Transcript copied to meta folder with original filename
- ✅ Code file written to meta folder with same name as original code path
- ✅ No code file added when code is not provided
- ✅ Video NOT moved to meta folder (remains in video directory)
- ✅ Correct directory selection (export vs shorts) based on `dryRun` flag

## Behavior Changes

### Before
```
/path/to/export/
├── my-video.mp4
└── my-video.md    <- Only article alongside video
```

### After
```
/path/to/export/
├── my-video.mp4   <- Video remains here
└── my-video_meta/  <- New meta folder
    ├── my-video.md     <- Article
    ├── transcript.txt  <- Transcript
    └── code.ts         <- Code (if provided)
```

## Usage Examples

### With Code Provided
```bash
pnpm cli create-auto-edited-video --generate-article --alongside
# User provides code file: /path/to/example.ts
# Result: Creates {VIDEO_NAME}_meta/ with article, transcript, and example.ts
```

### Without Code
```bash
pnpm cli create-auto-edited-video --generate-article --alongside
# User provides no code file
# Result: Creates {VIDEO_NAME}_meta/ with article and transcript only
```

### Upload to Shorts
```bash
pnpm cli create-auto-edited-video --generate-article --alongside --upload
# Result: Creates {VIDEO_NAME}_meta/ in shorts directory
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Operations
1. **Create meta directory**: `fs.makeDirectory(metaFolderPath, { recursive: true })`
2. **Write article**: `fs.writeFileString(articlePath, articleContent)`
3. **Copy transcript**: `fs.copyFile(transcriptPath, metaTranscriptPath)`
4. **Write code** (conditional): `fs.writeFileString(metaCodePath, codeContent)`

### Directory Logic
- **Export directory** (`dryRun: true`): `EXPORT_DIRECTORY/{VIDEO_NAME}_meta/`
- **Shorts directory** (`dryRun: false`): `SHORTS_EXPORT_DIRECTORY/{VIDEO_NAME}_meta/`

### Code File Handling
- If `codePath` provided: Uses `path.basename(codePath)` for filename in meta folder
- If no code provided: No code file operations performed
- Code content written directly (not copied) to preserve exact content

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ `--alongside` flag still requires `--generate-article`
- ✅ Default behavior unchanged (articles still go to article storage when `--alongside` not used)
- ✅ Queue processing logic maintains same interface

## Testing Strategy

Uses real filesystem operations with temporary directories following the established codebase pattern:
- Creates temporary directories with `mkdtempSync(path.join(import.meta.dirname, "tmp"))`
- Sets up real transcript and code files using `writeFileSync`
- Uses `NodeFileSystem.layer` for real filesystem operations instead of mocked filesystem
- Asserts against actual filesystem using `existsSync`, `readFileSync`, and `readdirSync`
- Proper cleanup with `rmSync(tmpdir, { recursive: true })` in finally blocks
- Tests both positive cases (with code) and negative cases (without code)
- Validates directory selection logic for export vs shorts directories
- Verifies file contents and folder structure using real filesystem reads

## Benefits

1. **Organized Content**: All related files packaged together in a logical structure
2. **Easy Discovery**: Single meta folder contains everything related to the video
3. **Preserved Workflow**: Video processing remains unchanged
4. **Flexible Code Support**: Works with or without code files
5. **Clear Naming**: `{VIDEO_NAME}_meta` makes purpose obvious
6. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing users unaffected

## Requirements Fulfilled

- ✅ **Article, transcript, and code packaged together**: All three file types included in meta folder
- ✅ **Single folder in finished videos section**: Creates one meta folder in appropriate video directory
- ✅ **Folder named `{VIDEO_NAME}_meta`**: Exact naming convention implemented
- ✅ **Video not moved**: Video remains in original location
- ✅ **Code uses same name as code path**: Original filename preserved
- ✅ **No code when not provided**: Conditional code file handling
- ✅ **Real filesystem testing approach**: Comprehensive test coverage with mocked operations

The `--alongside` flag now provides a complete content packaging solution for the Total TypeScript video workflow.
