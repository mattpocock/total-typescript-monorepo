Here are several important files needed for communicating from our internal CLI (`tt` globally) to Davinci Resolve

[commands.ts](mdc:apps/internal-cli/src/commands.ts) - where commands for the internal CLI are declared
[davinci-resolve.ts](mdc:packages/shared/src/davinci-resolve.ts) - the function we use for communicating with the davinci resolve scripts in the repo.
[add-subtitles.lua](mdc:packages/resolve-scripts/scripts/add-subtitles.lua) is an example of one of the davinci resolve scripts in the repo - in the `resolve-scripts` package.
[docs.txt](mdc:packages/resolve-scripts/scripts/docs.txt) is a file containing all the information needed to write Davinci resolve lua scripts.
