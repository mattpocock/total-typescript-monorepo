# Repository Feedback and CI Validation

## CI Check Requirement

**IMPORTANT**: Any time you need feedback on the repository state, changes, or overall health, you must run the CI pipeline first.

## Command to Run

```bash
pnpm run ci
```

This command should be executed from the **root directory** of the monorepo.

## When to Run CI

- Before providing feedback on code changes
- When assessing repository health
- Before suggesting improvements or modifications
- When validating that changes work correctly across the entire monorepo
- When troubleshooting build or test issues

## Why This Matters

The CI pipeline runs comprehensive checks across all packages and apps in the monorepo, including:
- TypeScript compilation
- Tests across all workspaces
- Linting and formatting
- Build processes
- Integration between packages

This ensures any feedback provided is based on the actual working state of the repository, not just surface-level observations.
